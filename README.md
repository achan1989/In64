In64
====

This project aims to use an SD card as a replacement for N64 cartridges.  The ultimate goals are:
    * be able to load a large number of N64 roms onto an SD card.
    * booting the N64 shows a menu containing all the roms on the card.
    * selecting a rom allows it to be played normally.


Hardware will be developed on a Digilent Atlys FPGA using only free tools and IP.
